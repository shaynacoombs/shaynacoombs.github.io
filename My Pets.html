<LI>I have a fur baby named CeCe Bug and she is a mini schnauzer. She's only a puppy, about 6 months old. Trust me CeCe is my little pain in the you know what. Even though she still messes in the house almost every day, I can't stay mad at her! She's just so stinking cute! Of course, being a small dog, means I'm going to pamper her with cute little outfits and costumes. CeCe currently has a winter vest, a halloween sweater, and a halloween costume which is a bumble bee. CeCe Bug is my spoiled little princess. </LI>

<LI>I also have a beta fish whose name is Calvin, as in Calvin Klein. I got him on a not so snowy snow day last winter. He's still kicking which is very shocking seeing though betas don't last more than a few months. He currently resides in Gannett Hall with me and my roommate. Hopefully he lives for a few more years!</LI>
