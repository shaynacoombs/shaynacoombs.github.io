<h3><p>Hello there! </p></h3>
<DIV>I go by Shay! Currently I am 18 years old, in my first year of college, but still manage to have sophomore credit standings. </DIV>
<DIV><I><B>How is this possible?</B></I></DIV>
<DIV>I participated in a dual enrollment program at my highschool which allowed me to finish my freshmen prerequisites and then some called the Bridge Program.</DIV>
<DIV><h3>Where I'm From</h3></DIV>
<DIV>I was born and raised in Bangor Maine. I lived in the same house on the same dead end street for all 18 years and counting. I never intended on staying in Maine, I always wanted to be in a big city, like Boston, but for now that dream has been put on the back burner because I don't have the financial means to go to school out of state. I'm trying to be smart by saving money going to school in state. So far I think I've made a good decision. </DIV>
<DIV><h3>Friends</h3></DIV>
<DIV>I have an amazing boyfriend named Noah Larson. We've currently been together for about 7 months. We do practically everything together (including my dog CeCe). Noah is going to Eastern Maine Community College and studying in their Criminal Justice Program. </DIV>

<DIV> My friend Alli has been my best friend since sophomore year in high school. She is always there when I need her and I am always there for her. Alli's boyfriend Corbin is also one of my closest friends. Because both Alli and Corbin are older than me they always said they were my "parents." But that is very suiting for them because they are like my family and I couldn't be more thankful for them.
