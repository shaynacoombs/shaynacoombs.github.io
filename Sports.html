<LI><h2>Swimming</h2></LI>
	<p> I was a competitive swimmer for the Y's Bangor Barracudas for 7 years. I started swimming competitively in the 1st grade. But I had always had the love for swimming, my parents always called me a fish because when we were at the lake they couldn't keep me out of the water. Which is the main reason my mom put me into the swim program at the Y in the first place. She definitely didn't know that I would be swimming across New England and even in Canada becoming one of the top 12 year olds in my division. However, team politics turned me away from the sport and into cheerleading.</p>
	
<LI><h2>Cheerleading</h2></LI>
	<p> I participated in the sport of cheerleading for 8 years. It started out as just cheering on the sidelines for a program in the 5th grade called Bangor Youth Football Cheerleading. Eventually it led to the passion of the sport leading into competitive cheering</p>
	<p> For two years I participated in an elite cheer gym called Cheer Magic. With that team I was able to travel across the east coast to compete in nationwide competitions. It was an experience of a lifetime with the sport that defined me. </p>
	<p> Of course I also cheered all four years of high school, and my high school I attended didn't take cheering easy. It was very competitive, especially with Lewiston High School. My senior year of high school ended my cheer career, but ended it in the most perfect way. My team made it to a competition in Rhode Island called "New Englands Championship Competition." Which is the top 10 teams from across New England all competing against each other to see whose the best. We ended up in 2nd place. </p>

<LI><h2>Anything Active</h2></LI>
<p> Physical activity is my favorite thing. I love being outside and hiking, and I especially love running. Funny right? I was for sure a gym rat up until I started college, I just haven't been able to fit the gym into my schedule. However, that doesn't mean I don't still get physical activities into my life. I constantly doing at home work outs while studying, walking my dog, and my job is all on my feet. </p>
